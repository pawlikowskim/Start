# Scope and hoisting

Variables and functions in JavaScript have function scope.


## Hoisting

Within given scope the code is being scanned in search for
variable and function declarations before execution. This
initial scan allows us to use variables / functions before 
declaration.

### Try it out

Open `index.html` file in the browser. 
Open `variable-scope.js` in WebStorm.
Change all `_` occurrences to values being equal with corresponding
variables.
